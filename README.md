# Power BI Financial Reporting & Analysis Dashboard

This project is a financial reporting suite built in Power BI as part of my training in Financial Analysis with Power BI. It includes fully interactive dashboards for:

Profit & Loss Statement – Sales, Gross Profit, Operating & Net Profit with margin KPIs.

Balance Sheet Statement – Assets vs Liabilities & Equity, including Capital Structure KPIs (Debt-to-Asset, Debt-to-Equity, Equity Ratio).

Cash Flow Statement – Operating, Investing & Financing cash flow trends.

Horizontal & Vertical Analysis – Year-over-year change analysis and common-size reporting.

Foreign Currency & FX Conversions – Daily transactions converted into USD with rolling averages.

## Key Insights from the dashboards

Profitability: Gross Profit Margin of ~68% and Net Margin near 19% show a strong bottom-line.

Capital Structure: Equity finances ~84% of assets, with modest leverage (Debt-to-Equity ~19%).

Cash Flow: Operating cash flows are consistently positive, supporting reinvestment.

Trend Analysis: Horizontal analysis highlights YoY growth in revenues, while vertical analysis shows cost structures as % of sales.
