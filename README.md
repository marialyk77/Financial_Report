# Power BI Financial Reporting & Analysis Dashboard

- This project is a financial reporting suite built in Power BI as part of my training in Financial Analysis with Power BI. It includes fully interactive dashboards for:

  - **Profit & Loss Statement** – Sales, Gross Profit, Operating & Net Profit with margin KPIs.

  - **Balance Sheet Statement** – Assets vs Liabilities & Equity, including Capital Structure KPIs (Debt-to-Asset, Debt-to-Equity, Equity Ratio).

  - **Cash Flow Statement** – Operating, Investing & Financing cash flow trends.

  - **Horizontal & Vertical Analysis** – Year-over-year change analysis and common-size reporting.

  - **Foreign Currency & FX Conversions** – Daily transactions converted into USD with rolling averages.




**While based on course material, I extended the project by:**

- Designing a **custom layout** and **color theme** for a professional look.

- Adding **KPI cards with contextual indicators**.

- Implementing **bookmarks** and **buttons** for interactive navigation and contextual drill-down insights

## Key Insights from the dashboards

- **Profitability:** Gross Profit Margin of ~68% and Net Margin near 19% show a strong bottom-line.

- **Capital Structure:** Equity finances ~84% of assets, with modest leverage (Debt-to-Equity ~19%).

- **Cash Flow:** Operating cash flows are consistently positive, supporting reinvestment.

- **Trend Analysis:**

**Horizontal Analysis:** Year-over-year growth is visible across sales and operating costs, but expenses, especially marketing and administration are rising at a faster pace than revenues in later years.

**Vertical Analysis:** While cost structures remain stable as a % of sales (COGS + OpEx), the Net Profit Margin is shrinking over time (22.9% → 16.5%), indicating profitability is being eroded by growing non-operating expenses (e.g., taxes, interest).
